# ASpaceGame

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this Github repository. Let's start by telling you that I am a big Star Trek fan and around the end of the 90s I remember playing a game called **Star Trek Starship Creator Warp II**.

This game allowed you to create your own starship, with a variety of parts and components, and then take her on missions, either provided by the game or by you, thanks to the included mission editor.

This project of mine, that I called **ASpaceGame** (**A** due to the fact that I'd like branding everything with my own personal website, [arduinilive.com](https://www.arduinilive.com), and **SpaceGame** because I'm not very creative with names :)), is a freely inspired creation based on that very old and terrific game.

I want to try to create something of mine which is inspired by that old software, but which can also be considered mine. This is **NOT** an attempt to infringe any Copyright or Intellectual Property, but just a fan-made project; for this reason, I'm not going to use any reference to Star Trek or any other copyrighted material, but I will try to come up with my own names, ideas and concepts.

## Code Architecture

The code is written mainly in C# and it's structured according to the following points:

- **ASpaceGame.CoreComponents**: this is a DLL class library that contains the core components of the game, such as classes, enums and utilities related to the inner core
- **ASpaceGame.Tests**: this is a DLL class library that contains the unit tests for the core components

### Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and considerate when interacting with others.

## License

We all know how much Star Trek stuff and words are common in many things of our day-to-day language, however I made the best effort to avoid using terminology that could be associated with Star Trek, when possible of course.

Regardless, please do let me know if something is out-of-place or mis-used and I'll do my best to remove it. Just remember that this is a fan-made project by a software developer enthusiast.
