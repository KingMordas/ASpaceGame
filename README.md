## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this Github repository. Let's start by telling you that I am a big Star Trek fan and around the end of the 90s I remember playing a game called **Star Trek Starship Creator Warp II**.

This game allowed you to create your own starship, with a variety of systems and facilities, and then take her on missions, either provided by the game or by you, thanks to the included mission editor.

This project of mine, that I called **ASpaceGame** (**A** due to the fact that I'd like branding everything with my own personal website, [arduinilive.com](https://www.arduinilive.com) - the A it's from there, and **SpaceGame** because I'm not very creative with names :)), is a freely inspired creation based on that very old and (from my pov) terrific game.

I want to create something of mine which is **inspired** by that old software, but with my own touch (and that of the community, should they desire to participate).

> Please, be aware that most of the terminology used in Star Trek has become very common in sci-fi productions (i.e. warp drive, shields, etc.); I'll do my best to try to avoid them when possible. Should you find something that is not appropriate, please let me know and I'll do my best to remove it.

### Code of Conduct

## License

We all know how much Star Trek stuff and words are common in many things of our day-to-day language, however I made the best effort to avoid using terminology that could be associated with Star Trek, when possible of course.

Regardless, please do let me know if something is out-of-place or mis-used and I'll do my best to remove it. Just remember that this is a fan-made project by a software developer enthusiast.
